# Code Style

## TypeScript Standards
- Use strict type checking
- Define interfaces/types for all data structures
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` if needed
- Use type guards for runtime type checking
- Export types/interfaces from dedicated type files
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- Group imports: external libraries, internal modules, types

## File Organization
- Backend: Organize by feature (routes, services, types, middleware)
- Frontend: Organize by feature (components, pages, hooks, services, types)
- Use consistent naming: PascalCase for components/types, camelCase for functions/variables
- Keep components small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
